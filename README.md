## Overview

It's alive! It works! I'm finally a father! I could cry.
The main issue with this was that there is no submit button, so it took a while for me to figure out how to retrieve the values from the input fields and how to make them stay accessible to perform calculations with them because no matter what I did the value was always undefined! But it's all good now. I'm good. I'm fine. It's fine, I swear. I am fine.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

### Built with

### What I learned

I learned that working with a form that doesn't get submitted anywhere is a pain in the ribs.

```
input::-webkit-outer-spin-button,
input::-webkit-inner-spin-button {
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  margin: .5rem;
}
```
this cool snippet hides those ugly arrows by the side of a number input field, but obviously, clearly, unsurprisingly, it does not work on firefox. because why would it. everything else doesn't.

### Continued development

I tried to keep the js DRY, but I just confused myself and made a mess, so I just put everything back the way it was because hey, at least it works. So I'll try to be drier in the future, shaken not stirred.
